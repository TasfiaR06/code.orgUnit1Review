        <b>Unit 1</b>
        <hr>
        <p> I've learned about the differences between a single-page web page and a multi-page website, the components of website content and structure, including headings, lists, HTML elements, and tags. Additionally, I've gained knowledge about URLs, analog and digital data, sampling, and problem-solving steps. There's also information about HTML elements like image tags, hyperlink tags, paragraph tags, heading tags, unordered and ordered lists, line breaks, and the doctype declaration.
</p>

      <div class="wave" id="u2">
        <b>Unit 2</b>
        <hr>
        <p>  I've learned about the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which focuses on sending information quickly without ensuring accuracy, contrasting it with protocols that prioritize accuracy but are slower. UDP operates by sending packets without checking if they all reach their destination or arrive in order, making it suitable for applications where speed is crucial, like video conferencing or online gaming. Additionally, I've gained insights into other networking concepts such as TCP, IP, DNS, HTTP, and the physical network, as well as the digital divide and the concept of packets in computer networking.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wave" id="u3">
        <b>Unit 3</b>
        <hr>
        <p>I've learned about the concept of applications (apps) and their distinction between desktop and mobile versions. Applications run within the operating system and can be either sequentially programmed, where statements run in order without user interaction, or event-driven, where program statements run when triggered by events like mouse clicks or key presses. I've also gained insights into user interface (UI) design and the importance of meeting user needs, as well as software documentation, comments in source code, debugging, and the difference between testing and debugging in the software development process.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wave" id="u4">
        <b>Unit 4</b>
        <hr>
        <p>I've learned about various concepts in unit 4.These include expressions, assignment operators, strings, variables, abstraction, parameters, algorithms, conditions, conditional statements, pixels, screen space, pixel art, simulations, software libraries, procedures, Boolean logic, relational operators, function and procedure calls, rules, mechanics, rewards, procedural abstraction, and pseudocode. Additionally, I've gained insights into the real-world connections of these concepts and their applications in programming and computer systems.
