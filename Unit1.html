      <b>Lesson 1</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h5>
      <h6>My learning strategies include breaking down complex topics into smaller, more manageable chunks, actively interacting with the information through practice and application, and teaching concepts to others to help consolidate my comprehension. These tactics are consistent with the student's strategy of taking notes on paper and testing themselves.</h6>

      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. Recall when you built your information-sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</h5>
      <h6>-Turn light 1

        on with blue colors.
        -Turn light 2

      <b>Lesson 3</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h5>
      <h6>Numbers are like symbols that represent how many of something there is. We use a system where we have ten symbols, from 0 to 9, and we group them together to represent bigger quantities. The position of each symbol in a number tells us its value. We can use these numbers to do math, like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 4</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h5>
      <h6>Both binary and decimal systems are numeral systems used for representing numbers, utilizing positional notation for value determination. However, the decimal system employs 10 symbols (0-9) and has a base of 10, while the binary system uses only 2 symbols (0 and 1) with a base of 2. While decimal numbers represent a broader range of values, binary numbers are extensively used in computing and digital electronics.

      <b>Lesson 5</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h5>
      <h6>Not all possible fractions can be created when using bits for representation. This is because there's an infinite number of fractions, but a finite number of bits available for representation.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 7</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</h5>
      <h6>c.The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.</h6>
        <h6>d.The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.</h6>
      <h5>2. When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h5>
      <h6>To sample the 4" x 6" black and white image effectively, I would use a pixelation widget to divide the image into squares. The sample size would depend on the desired level of detail, with smaller sizes resulting in lower resolution and larger sizes providing more detail but requiring more memory.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 8</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</h5>
      <h6>RBG pixels and binary sequences combine to produce a digital color image by informing the computer where the RBG pixel will be placed and what shade or color that pixel is.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 9</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider. If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?
</h5>
      <h6>The decrease in file size when attaching the book to the email is due to compression by the email provider, not deletion of content. Compression reduces the file size for efficient transmission while preserving the book's content.

      <b>Lesson 10</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4> 
      <h5>1. You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?
</h5>
      <h6> Text messages and music are best compressed using lossless compression to maintain accuracy. Images, video, and some music benefit from lossy compression to reduce file size, sacrificing some quality for storage efficiency.

      <b>Lesson 11</b>
      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?</h5>
      <h6>C.It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</h6>
      <h5>2. As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario:
      Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.
      Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?
</h5>
      <h6>To make the scenario from the warm-up okay regarding copyright, the person selling the T-shirts would need permission from the image creator or the appropriate licensing rights to use it commercially</h6>

      <h4> Check For Understanding</h4>
      <h5>1. Thinking about what I learned in this unit, I feel like I understand...</h5>
      <h6> B. most of the concepts, but not all of them</h6>
      <h5>2. I can really be myself in this computer science class.</h5>
      <h6> B.Agree</h6>
      <h5>What else would you like your teacher to know about this class? For example: what did you like best about the class, or what is one thing that could make the class better?</h5>
      <h6>One thing I liked about this class was the hands-on activities and practical applications. More real-world examples and case studies could enrich the learning experience further.</h6>
